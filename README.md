# 🐄 Longitudinal Analysis of Farm Animal Growth – Crag House Farm (UK)

This project investigates the factors affecting the weight and growth of lambs and cows using longitudinal data collected from Crag House Farm in Leeds, UK. The study employs Linear Mixed Models (LMMs) to identify key predictors of livestock growth and build accurate predictive models using statistical tuning techniques.

## 🧰 Tools & Methodologies
- **Language:** R
- **Techniques Used:**  
  - Data cleaning, transformation, and integration (animal + weather data)  
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): histograms, box plots, line charts, correlation matrices  
  - Statistical modeling using **Linear Mixed Models (LMMs)** for hierarchical time-series data  
  - **Cross-validation** and **feature selection** for model tuning  
  - Evaluation metrics: **RMSE**, **AIC**

## 📊 Key Findings
- **Significant predictors:** age, birth type, weaning weight, sire, and weather conditions
- Tuned LMMs showed high predictive accuracy (RMSE ≈ 2.5 kg for lambs, 25 kg for cows)
- Birth weight, sire, and specific animal types significantly influenced growth
- Provided farmers with a data-driven framework to improve livestock management and profitability

## 🐑 Real-world Collaboration
- Conducted in collaboration with **Crag House Farm**, involving on-site visits and regular communication with farm staff to align statistical findings with real farm practices.

## 🔜 Coming Soon
R code for data wrangling, model building, and visualisation will be added.
